# Public Headers

The canonical C ABI for the native message box library will be published here. The primary entry point will be `native_message_box.h`, containing:

- Versioning macros and ABI compatibility notes.
- Struct and enum definitions for message box configuration and results.
- Function declarations for initialization, display, and shutdown routines.

Additional headers may be added for advanced features (e.g., callbacks, diagnostics).
